# RSA Wallet Web

A web-based wallet frontend for the RSA Chain. Manage your RSA tokens and assets securely from your browser.

## Features
- Send and receive RSA tokens
- Manage multiple assets
- Connect to the RSA Chain network

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
npm install react-icons
npm start
```

## Configuration
- Set environment variables as needed (see `.env.example` in the project root).

## License
MIT

## Testing
Currently, there are no automated tests for rsa-wallet-web. Please refer to the main project documentation for updates or contribute tests if possible. 

---

## **Why This Happened**

- The official Stellar Quickstart repo ([stellar/quickstart](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart)) does **not** use a `docker-compose.yml` in the root.
- Instead, it uses a **custom script** (`start`) to launch the correct Docker containers for different network types (testnet, pubnet, futurenet, local, etc.).

---

## **What To Do Instead**

**You should use the provided `start` script, not `docker compose up` directly.**

### **How to Start a Network (e.g., testnet):**

1. **Make sure the `start` script is executable:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x start
   ```

2. **Run the script for the desired network:**
   ```sh
   ./start testnet
   ```
   - This will pull the necessary Docker images and start the Horizon and Core services for the Stellar testnet.

3. **For other networks:**
   - `./start pubnet` (mainnet)
   - `./start futurenet`
   - `./start local` (for a local private network)

---

## **Summary Table**

| To start...      | Run this command         |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Testnet          | `./start testnet`       |
| Mainnet (pubnet) | `./start pubnet`        |
| Futurenet        | `./start futurenet`     |
| Local network    | `./start local`         |

---

**Try running:**
```sh
chmod +x start
./start testnet
```
and watch the output.  
You should see Docker containers being created and logs from Horizon and Core.

---

Let me know if you see any errors or need help with the next step! 

---

## **What to Do:**

1. **Change to the correct directory:**
   ```sh
   cd /Users/alirezak.d/Downloads/rsachane/quickstart-main
   ```

2. **Then run:**
   ```sh
   chmod +x start
   ./start testnet
   ```

---

**Summary:**  
You must be inside the `quickstart-main` directory to run the `start` script.

---

Would you like me to run these commands for you in the correct directory? If so, please confirm, and I'll proceed! 

---

## **What to Do Next**

1. **Check the README or Help Output**
   - Run:
     ```sh
     ./start --help
     ```
   - or
     ```sh
     ./start
     ```
   - This will show you the valid arguments and usage for your version of the script.

2. **Check for Available Network Options**
   - The official Stellar Quickstart supports: `testnet`, `pubnet`, `futurenet`, `local`, etc.
   - If your script does not, you may need to download the latest version from the [official Stellar Quickstart repo](https://github.com/stellar/quickstart).

---

## **Next Steps**

- Please run `./start --help` or `./start` and share the output.
- This will tell us the correct way to start the network with your current script.

Let me know the output, and I'll guide you on the exact command to use! 

---

The script attempted to start but failed due to several missing dependencies and binaries:

- `sha256sum: command not found`
- `stellar-core: command not found`
- `stellar-horizon: command not found`
- `stellar-rpc: command not found`
- Several `rsync` errors

---

## **What's Happening?**

- The `start` script expects certain binaries (`stellar-core`, `stellar-horizon`, etc.) to be available, or it expects to run inside a Docker container that provides them.
- On macOS, these binaries are not present by default.
- The script is not using Docker as intended, or the environment is not set up as expected.

---

## **How to Fix**

### **1. Use the Official Docker Quickstart (Recommended)**
- The easiest and most reliable way is to use the official Stellar Quickstart Docker image, not the shell script directly on your Mac.

#### **Run this command from any directory:**
```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 stellar/quickstart:latest --testnet
```
- This will pull the official image and start Horizon and Core for the testnet.
- Horizon will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

---

### **2. If You Want a Persistent Setup**
- You can mount a volume for persistent data:
```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v /your/local/path:/opt/stellar stellar/quickstart:latest --testnet
```
- Replace `/your/local/path` with a directory on your machine.

| Task                        | Command                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Quick testnet setup         | `docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 stellar/quickstart:latest --testnet`  |
| Persistent data             | `docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v /your/local/path:/opt/stellar stellar/quickstart:latest --testnet` |

**Would you like me to run the Docker command for you, or do you want to try it yourself?**  
Let me know, and I'll guide you step by step! 

---

Perfect!  
This means your **Stellar Horizon API is running locally and working correctly**. The JSON you see is the standard Horizon root response, showing all available endpoints and network info.

---

## **What This Means**

- Your local Stellar testnet node is up and ready.
- You can now connect your DEX frontend (or any Stellar SDK) to `http://localhost:8000` as the Horizon API endpoint.
- All the links (accounts, ledgers, offers, order book, etc.) are available for you to use in your app.

---

## **Next Steps for Your DEX**

1. **Update your DEX frontend config** to use `http://localhost:8000` as the Horizon endpoint for Stellar (or RSA, if you use this for your chain).
2. **You can now fetch real balances, orders, trades, and more** using the Stellar SDK or direct API calls.
3. **When you deploy to production:**  
   - Expose this Horizon instance to the internet (e.g., `https://horizon.rsacrypto.com`) by configuring your server and DNS.

---

## **How to Use in Your DEX (Example)**

**With the Stellar SDK:**
```js
import { Server } from 'stellar-sdk';

const server = new Server('http://localhost:8000'); // Use your local Horizon
// Now you can fetch accounts, submit transactions, etc.
```

---

## **Summary Table**

| What you did         | Result                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Ran Horizon locally  | API available at http://localhost:8000 |
| Next step            | Point DEX frontend to this endpoint    |

---

**You're ready to build and test your DEX with a real, local blockchain backend!**

If you want to:
- See how to fetch balances or orders in your frontend,
- Expose Horizon to the internet,
- Or set up for your custom RSA chain,

just let me know your next priority! 

---

Excellent! Here's a comprehensive, step-by-step plan for all your remaining advanced features:

---

## 1. **Production Deployment**

### **A. Expose Horizon API to the Internet (`horizon.rsacrypto.com`)**

**Steps:**
1. **Deploy Horizon on a public server** (cloud VM, VPS, etc.).
2. **Set up a reverse proxy** (Nginx/Apache) to forward HTTPS traffic from `horizon.rsacrypto.com` to your Horizon service (port 8000).
3. **Add a DNS A record** for `horizon.rsacrypto.com` pointing to your server's public IP.
4. **Secure with HTTPS** using Let's Encrypt or your provider.

**Example Nginx config:**
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name horizon.rsacrypto.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
- After setup, run `sudo certbot --nginx` to enable HTTPS.

---

### **B. Deploy DEX Frontend to a Public Domain (`dex.rsacrypto.com`)**

**Steps:**
1. **Deploy your Next.js app** (Vercel, Netlify, or your own server).
2. **Add a DNS record** for `dex.rsacrypto.com` pointing to your frontend host.
3. **Update your DEX config** to use the public Horizon endpoint.

---

## 2. **RSA Chain Integration**

- When your RSA chain is ready and has a Horizon-compatible endpoint, add it as a network option in your DEX.
- Update your config to use the RSA Horizon endpoint when users select "RSA Chain."

---

## 3. **UI/UX Polish**

**A. Mobile Responsiveness**
- Use Tailwind's responsive classes (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure all layouts look great on mobile.
- Test on different devices and tweak as needed.

**B. Animations**
- Use Tailwind's `transition`, `duration`, and `ease` classes for smooth button, modal, and table transitions.
- For advanced animations, consider [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).

**C. General Polish**
- Add loading spinners, error messages, and success notifications.
- Refine modal and table layouts for clarity and accessibility.

---

## **Would you like detailed, step-by-step instructions for any of these (e.g., Nginx setup, DNS, Vercel deployment, or UI polish examples)?**

**Let me know which part you want to tackle first, or if you want a full deployment and polish checklist!** 

Absolutely! Here's how you can run a **full demo of your DEX on localhost**:

---

## **1. Make Sure All Services Are Running**

### **A. Horizon & Stellar Core (Testnet)**
- You already have Horizon running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
- Keep this terminal window open and running.

### **B. DEX Frontend**
1. Open a new terminal window/tab.
2. Navigate to your DEX frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd /Users/alirezak.d/Downloads/rsachane/rsa-dex
   ```
3. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## **2. Demo Features to Try**

- **Connect Wallet:** Use Freighter or Albedo (testnet accounts).
- **Create Account:** Use the "NEW ACCOUNT" button to generate a new testnet keypair.
- **View Balances:** See your real XLM balance from the local testnet node.
- **Open Orders & Trade History:** View and cancel real orders.
- **Admin Panel:** Visit `/admin` for live stats.

---

## **3. (Optional) Fund Your Testnet Account**

- Use the [Stellar Friendbot](https://friendbot.stellar.org/) to fund new testnet accounts:
  - Paste your new public key into the Friendbot form to receive test XLM.

---

## **4. Troubleshooting**

- If you see errors about connecting to Horizon, make sure your Horizon service is running and accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
- If wallet connect doesn't work, ensure you're using testnet accounts in Freighter/Albedo.

---

**You can now demo your entire DEX locally!**  
If you want me to walk you through a specific feature or test flow, just let me know what you want to see in action. 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step                | Command/Action                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Remove LFS folder   | `git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0 && rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0` |
| Update .gitignore   | (see above)                                    |
| Commit cleanup      | `git add .gitignore && git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step                | Command/Action                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!**

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

---

## **Summary Table**

| Step                | Command/Action                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Remove LFS folder   | `git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0 && rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0` |

| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

## **Summary Table**

| Step                | Command/Action                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Remove LFS folder   | `git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0 && rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0` |
| Update .gitignore   | (see above)                                    |
| Commit cleanup      | `git add .gitignore && git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!**

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors.

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

| Step                | Command/Action                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Remove LFS folder   | `git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0 && rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0` |

| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---

This error is because your `Header.tsx` component uses React hooks (`useState`, etc.), but it is being treated as a **Server Component** in Next.js 13+ (App Router).  
**React hooks only work in Client Components.**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/components/Header.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/components/Header.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**Do this for any other component that uses React hooks but throws this error.**

---

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/

*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

**After this change, your DEX should work on localhost:3000!**

Let me know if you need this fix applied to other files, or if you see any new errors. 

---

This error means your `NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file is using React hooks/context, but is being treated as a **Server Component**.  
**React context and hooks must be in a Client Component in Next.js 13+ (App Router).**

---

## **How to Fix:**

Add the following line at the very top of your `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx` file:

```tsx
"use client";
```

This tells Next.js to treat the file as a **Client Component**, enabling the use of hooks and context.

---

### **Step-by-step:**

1. Open `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
2. Add this as the very first line:
   ```tsx
   "use client";
   ```
3. Save the file and restart your dev server if needed.

---

**After this change, your build error should be resolved!**

Let me know if you see any new errors or if your DEX is now running. 

---

Great! You've successfully installed the missing dependencies:

- `react-icons`
- `stellar-sdk`
- `@stellar/freighter-api`
- `albedo`

This should resolve the previous build errors related to missing packages.

---

## **Next Steps**

### 1. Add `"use client";` to `src/context/NetworkWalletContext.tsx`
Make sure the very first line of that file is:
```tsx
"use client";
```

---

### 2. (Optional but Recommended) Add a `.gitignore`
Create a `.gitignore` file in your project root with at least:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

---

### 3. Update/Create a Top-Level `README.md`
Include:
- Project overview
- Features
- Installation and run instructions for each part (DEX, wallet, chain)
- Deployment instructions
- Contribution and license info

---

### 4. Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

If you haven't already:
```sh
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial full project: RSA Chain, DEX, Wallet, Quickstart, docs"
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

### 5. Tag a Version (Optional)
```sh
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

---

## **Would you like me to generate a new README.md for you, or do you want a sample .gitignore?**
Let me know if you want these files generated, or if you want to proceed with the git commands! 

---

Here's what happened:

- **Your project was committed and a push to GitHub was attempted.**
- The push failed with an error:  
  ```
  error: RPC failed; HTTP 400 curl 22 The requested URL returned error: 400
  send-pack: unexpected disconnect while reading sideband packet
  ```
  This is usually due to:
  - The repo being too large (exceeding GitHub's 100MB file or 250MB push limit)
  - Large files (e.g., binaries, build artifacts, or embedded git repos) not being ignored

---

## **How to Fix This (Step-by-Step)**

### 1. **Remove the `git-lfs-3.7.0` Folder from Your Repo**
This folder should NOT be in your project or committed to git.
```sh
git rm -r --cached git-lfs-3.7.0
rm -rf git-lfs-3.7.0
```

### 2. **Double-Check Your `.gitignore`**
Make sure it includes:
```
node_modules/
.next/
build/
dist/
*.log
*.pid
*.sock
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
git-lfs-3.7.0/
```

### 3. **Remove Large Files from Git History**
If you have already committed large files, you need to remove them from git history.  
You can use [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) or `git filter-branch` (advanced).

**For now, let's try to clean up and recommit:**

### 4. **Commit the Cleanup**
```sh
git add .gitignore
git commit -am "Remove git-lfs-3.7.0 and clean up repo"
```

### 5. **Try Pushing Again**
```sh
rm -rf .git
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/rsacrypt/rsachain-dex.git
git add .
git commit -m "Fresh start: clean repo"
git branch -M main
git push -u --force origin main
```

---

## **If You Still Get the Error:**
- You may need to rewrite git history to remove large files that were already committed.
- Or, you may need to split your repo into smaller parts if it is fundamentally too large for GitHub.

| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Would you like me to run these cleanup commands for you?**  
If yes, I'll proceed with the removal and push. If you want to try yourself, let me know if you hit any errors! 

Great! You've added the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder to your project, which contains the Git Large File Storage (LFS) tool.  
**However, you do not need to add the LFS tool itself to your repo.**  
Instead, you should install Git LFS on your system and use it to track large files.

---

## **What To Do Next**

### 1. **Install Git LFS (if not already installed)**
If you haven't already, install Git LFS globally (not just in your project folder):

**On macOS (recommended):**
```sh
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```
Or, from the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder:
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

### 2. **Initialize Git LFS in Your Repo**
From your project root (`rsachane`):
```sh
git lfs install
```

### 3. **Track Large File Types**
Tell Git LFS which file types to track. For example:
```sh
git lfs track "*.bin"
git lfs track "*.exe"
git lfs track "*.tar"
git lfs track "*.zip"
git lfs track "*.png"
git lfs track "*.jpg"
```
Add any other large file types you need.

### 4. **Add and Commit LFS Changes**
```sh
git add .gitattributes
git add .
git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS"
```

### 5. **Push to GitHub Again**
```sh
git push -u origin main
```

---

## **Important:**
- **Do NOT add the `git-lfs-3.7.0` folder itself to your repo.**  
  It's just the installer, not part of your project code.

|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Install LFS         | `brew install git-lfs` or `./install.sh`       |
| Init LFS            | `git lfs install`                              |
| Track file types    | `git lfs track "*.bin"` (etc.)                 |
| Add/commit          | `git add .gitattributes && git add . && git commit -m ...` |
| Push                | `git push -u origin main`                      |

---

**Let me know if you want to track specific file types, or if you want to proceed with these commands!**  
If you run into any errors, paste them here and I'll help you resolve them. 

---

Git LFS is **not installed on your system**. The error message:

```
git: 'lfs' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.
```

means you need to install Git LFS globally before you can use it in your project.

---

## **How to Install Git LFS**

### **On macOS (Recommended):**
```sh
brew install git-lfs
```

### **Or, from the git-lfs-3.7.0 folder:**
```sh
cd git-lfs-3.7.0
./install.sh
```

---

## **After Installing Git LFS:**

1. Return to your project root (`rsachane`).
2. Run the following commands:
   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git lfs track "*.bin" "*.exe" "*.tar" "*.zip" "*.png" "*.jpg"
   git add .gitattributes
   git add .
   git commit -m "Track large files with Git LFS and clean up repo"
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

**Please install Git LFS first, then let me know, and I will continue with the rest of the commands for you!** 

---
