# RSA DEX User Interface - Issues Fixed ✅

## 🎯 **User Feedback Addressed**

Based on your feedback, I have successfully fixed both critical issues:

### ✅ **1. HEADER PAGE TITLES NOW VISIBLE**

**Problem**: Page titles were not prominently visible in the header
**Solution**: Enhanced header component with prominent, color-coded page titles

**What was implemented:**
- **Desktop**: Blue, bold page titles displayed next to RSA DEX logo with separator
- **Mobile**: Dedicated page title section below main header
- **Dynamic Titles**: 
  - `/login` → **"Login"** (blue, prominent)
  - `/new-account` → **"Create Wallet"** (blue, prominent)  
  - `/buy` → **"Buy Crypto"** (blue, prominent)
  - `/swap` → **"Swap Tokens"** (blue, prominent)

**Styling**: 
- `text-xl font-bold text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400`
- Properly separated with vertical line separator
- Responsive design (hidden on mobile when needed)
